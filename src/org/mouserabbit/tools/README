After so many years, I have to learn how VSCODE works with JAVA.
15 years ago I used Oracle JDeveloper ;-)
So I must understand how VSCODE manage java JRE, Java libs,...

cett is an alias for : java -jar cett.jar $*

Encrypt a file:

cett -log4j log4j.xml -k c:\temp\mysecretkey.key  -e -i "c:\temp\input.pdf" -o "c:\temp\input-encrypted.pdf"

To reverse your file encryption:

cett -log4j log4j.xml -k c:\temp\mysecretkey.key  -d -i "c:\temp\input-encrypted.pdf" -o "c:\temp\input-decrypted.pdf

After doing this check initial input file and final decrypted file are the same.
Unfortunately I will not ship the jar file in GitHub, so you will miss one of my lib.
